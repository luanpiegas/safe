# Safe

Safe is a simple fork of version [9.0.10](https://github.com/roots/sage/releases/tag/9.0.10) from [Sage](https://github.com/roots/sage), the latest version before Sage 10.

Works well with [Bun](https://bun.sh/)!

### Instalation:

I recommend using version 12.x of NodeJS or Bun.
```bash
nvm install 12
nvm use 12
```
If you get errors linked to `node-sass` package, run the rebuild script to make it work on you OS:
```bash
bun run build:rebuild
```
or 
```bash
yarn build:rebuild
```
